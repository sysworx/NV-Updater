# NV Updater

NV Updater is a free tool designed to simplify the process of updating Nvidia GeForce graphics card drivers. 

## Advantages

* **No NVIDIA Account Required:** Unlike the official method through GeForce Experience, NV Updater doesn't need an NVIDIA account.
* **No GeForce Experience Installation:** GeForce Experience is often considered bloated. NV Updater doesn't install this additional software.
* **Component Control:** NV Updater allows you to remove unwanted components like telemetry or GeForce Experience during the driver installation.

## How it Works

1. **Driver Detection:** NV Updater automatically detects your graphics card and installed operating system.
2. **Driver Selection:** It displays available driver versions, including:
    * Studio Drivers (for optimal stability) 
    * Game Ready Drivers (for the latest games)
3. **Installation:** The selected driver is downloaded and installed. You can remove unwanted components during this process.

## Important Notes

* **.NET Framework 4.7.2 Required:** Make sure .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher is installed on your system.
* **Manual Installation:** NV Updater offers the option to manually install the downloaded driver if the automatic installation fails.
* **Backup:** It's recommended to create a backup of your current driver before updating.

## Alternatives

* **GeForce Experience:** The official method from NVIDIA, but it requires an NVIDIA account and installs GeForce Experience.
* **Manual Driver Update:** You can also download the driver directly from the NVIDIA website and install it manually. This requires more technical knowledge.

## Conclusion

NV Updater is a convenient alternative for users who want to update their Nvidia drivers without an NVIDIA account or GeForce Experience. It offers more control over the installation process and removes unwanted components.

## Disclaimer

Please note that driver updates can sometimes lead to problems. Always create a backup before updating drivers, and use NV Updater at your own risk.
